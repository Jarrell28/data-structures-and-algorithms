# Insertion Sort 

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.

## Pros of Insertion Sort

 - Simple implementation
 
 - Efficient for (quite) small data sets
 
 - Adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted
 
 - Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
 
 - In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
 
 - More efficient in practice than most other simple algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort
