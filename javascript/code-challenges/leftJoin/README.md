# Hashtables
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.


## Challenge Summary
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.


## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to loops through both hashmaps and set the key/value pairs into the new hash and return. It does work for combining the values, but if the value doesn't exist in the second hashmap, I wasn't able to append NULL.
