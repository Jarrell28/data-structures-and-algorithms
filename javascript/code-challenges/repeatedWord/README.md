# Hashtables
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.


## Challenge Summary
Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter and returns the first word that is repeated


## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to split the string into an array and then loop through the array, adding the word to the hashtable. This way I would be able to easily check if the word already exists in the hashtable, and if it does then return word.
