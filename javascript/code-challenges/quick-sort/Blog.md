# Quick Sort 

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

## Pros of Quick Sort

- It is in-place since it uses only a small auxiliary stack.
 
- It requires only n (log n) time to sort n items.

- It has an extremely short inner loop.

- This algorithm has been subjected to a thorough mathematical analysis, a very precise statement can be made about performance issues.
