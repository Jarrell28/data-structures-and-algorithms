# Hashtables
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.


## Challenge Description
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

- set
- get
- contains
- hash

## API

set(key, val) - Takes a key value pair and adds it to the hashtable

get(key) - Takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

hash(key) - Takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

contains(key) - Takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
